## Introduction
This project is designed to implement a line-following robot using embedded electronics principles. The code is written in Python and is tailored to work with specific hardware setups used in the course.

## Features
- **Line Detection**: Uses sensors to detect and follow a line.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Basic obstacle detection and avoidance.
- **Speed Control**: Adjusts speed based on line curvature and obstacles.
- **Modular Code**: Easy to modify and extend for different hardware configurations.
